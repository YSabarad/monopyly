<h2>
    The Rules
</h2>

<h3>
    Entering and Play-offs
</h3>
<p>
    The competition is only open to employees of BNP Paribas.
    The closing date for entries is Tuesday 28th January 2014.
    Entries must be mailed as a zip file to richard.s.shepherd@gmail.com by this date.
    The final will be played on Friday 31st January.
</p>

<p>
    In advance of the final a tournament will be played between all entries.
    A large number of rounds will be played - the number will depend on the speed of the AIs.
    The four AIs which win the most games will be picked to play in the final. You may enter
    more than one AI, but no more than one AI from each entrant will be picked for the final.
</p>
<p>
    The final will be a one-round tournament of the top four AIs. That is to say that twenty-four
    games will be played to play all the permutations of AIs playing in first, second, third and
    fourth places.
</p>

<h3>
    Prizes
</h3>
<p>
    The prizes are kindly sponsored by BNP Paribas CIB Architecture.
    <ul>
    <li>
      An <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>
      for the winner of the most games in the final.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Monopoly-HAS40753-Nostalgia-Wooden-Edition/dp/B0002VZ2OG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1387126497&sr=8-1&keywords=monopoly+nostalgia">'Nostalgia edition' Monopoly set</a>
      for the AI with the most efficient code.
    </li>
    </ul>
    Most efficient code means the AI that uses the least CPU time to make its decisions.
</p>
<p>
    The main prize, of course, is the kudos that goes with being the winner of the Christmas Coding Challenge!
</p>

<h3>
    Differences between the standard rules and Monopyly rules
</h3>
<p>
    Standard Monopoly has limited numbers of houses and hotels, and some obscure rules about
    what to do when they run out. Monopyly has unlimited houses and hotels.
</p>
<p>
    In standard Monopoly rules you can build houses at any point in the game.
    In Monopyly you can only build houses in your own turn.
</p>
<p>
    Standard Monopoly rules say that you must sell all houses before transferring a
    property to another player as part of a deal. Monopyly lets you do this as long as
    you transfer the whole set. Similarly, standard Monopoly rules say that a player
    receiving a mortgaged property in a deal must immediately unmortgage it. Monopyly
    does not impose this condition.
</p>
<p>
    In standard Monopoly rules, if a player goes bankrupt all their properties are
    immediately put up for auction. In Monopyly, they are just returned to the bank.
</p>
<p>
    A standard Monopoly game could theoretically last for ever.
    Monopyly has a limit of 500 rounds per game. If this limit is reached, the player
    with the highest 'net worth' is the winner. Net worth = cash + sale value of houses + mortage
    value of properties.
</p>

<h3>
    Rules for AIs
</h3>
<p>
    Any entry found to be breaking the rules below will be excluded from the competition.
</p>
<p>
    AIs must not change the state of the game except through the interactions defined by
    the PlayerAIBase API. This includes, but is not limited to:
    changing the cash or properties owned by any player; changing the state of the board
    or the Chance or Community Chest cards; setting the random seed used by the dice; 'stealing'
    CPU from other players by running extra threads.
    You know what I mean: No 'Kobayashi Maru' style cheating!
</p>
<p>
    AIs must not deliberately act favourably towards other specific AIs.
    You may enter multiple AIs into the competition, but you are not allowed to
    enter 'sacrificial' AIs which deliberately boost other AIs chances of winning.
</p>
<p>
    You <u>are</u> allowed to remember details about other players' behaviour between
    games. Only one instance of your AI is created for the whole tournament and is
    reused for each game. So if you want, you can learn how other AIs behave and use
    that information in subsequent games.
</p>
