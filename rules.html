<h3>
    Entering and Play-offs
</h3>
<p>
    The closing date for entries is Tuesday 28th January 2014.
    Entries must be mailed as a zip file to richard.s.shepherd@gmail.com by this date.
    The final will be played on Friday 31st January.
</p>

<p>
    In advance of the final a tournament will be played between all entries. This will
    consist of all entries playing all other entries in every permutation of four players.
    A large number of rounds will be played - the number will depend on the speed of the AIs.
    The four AIs which win the most games will be picked to play in the final. You may enter
    more than one AI, but no more than one AI from each entrant will be picked for the final.
</p>
<p>
    The final will be a one-round tournament of the top four AIs. That is to say that twenty-four
    games will be played to play all the permutations of AIs playing in first, second, third and
    fourth places.
</p>

<h3>
    Prizes
</h3>
<p>
    There will be two winners, picked from the final four: the overall winner who wins the most games,
    and the AI which uses the least processing time. The overall winner will receive a
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_16gb_2013">2103 model Nexus 7 tablet</a>.
    The winner of the most-efficient code will win a
    <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Monopoly-HAS40753-Nostalgia-Wooden-Edition/dp/B0002VZ2OG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1387126497&sr=8-1&keywords=monopoly+nostalgia">wooden-boxed 'nostalgia edition' Monopoly set</a>.
</p>

<h3>
    Rules for AIs
</h3>
<p>
    Any entry found to be breaking the rules below will be excluded from the competition.
</p>
<p>
    AIs must not change the state of the game except through the interactions defined by
    the PlayerAIBase API. This includes, but is not limited to:
    changing the cash or properties owned by any player; changing the state of the board
    or the Chance or Community Chest cards; setting the random seed used by the dice; 'stealing'
    CPU from other players by running extra threads.
</p>
<p>
    AIs must not deliberately act favourably towards other specific AIs.
    You may enter multiple AIs into the competition, but you are not allowed to
    enter 'sacrificial' AIs which deliberately boost other AIs chances of winning.
</p>
<p>
    You <u>are</u> allowed to remember details about other players' behaviour between
    games. Only one instance of your AI is created for the whole tournament and is
    reused for each game. So if you want, you can learn how other AIs behave and use
    that information in subsequent games.
</p>
