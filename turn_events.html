<h2>
    Sequence of Events in a Turn
</h2>

<h3>
    Standard events
</h3>
<p>
    A turn has the events below. For each event, the Monopyly framework will call into
    methods defined in PlayerAIBase. You can override any of these methods in your AI
    to provide your own custom handling of them.

<ul>
    <li>
        All players are notified of the start of turn via the start_of_turn() method.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can propose up to three deals with other players via the propose_deal() method.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you are in jail, you are given the chance to buy your way out via the get_out_of_jail() method.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can unmortgage properties via the unmortgage_properties() method.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have complete, unmortgaged sets you can build houses via the build_houses() method.
    </li>
    <li>
        Dice are rolled and you are moved (if you are not in jail).
    </li>
    <li>
        Action is taken depending on the square you land on.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>
    Buying properties and auctioning
</h3>
<p>
    When you land on an unowned property, you are given the option to buy it via
    the landed_on_unowned_property() method. If you choose to buy it, the money
    will be taken from you and you get the property.
</p>
<p>
    If you choose not to buy the property, it is put up for auction. Auctioning is
    done by getting 'sealed bids' from each player via the property_offered_for_auction()
    method. The highest bidding player gets the property, and pays Â£1 more than the
    second-highest bid (like an eBay auction).
</p>

<h3>
    Events when money is taken from a player
</h3>
<p>
    Whenever money needs to be taken from you, the sequence of events below is
    followed. This happens, for example, if you need to pay a fine or when you
    are buying properties or houses.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The money_will_be_taken() method is called.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can make up to three deals, via the propose_deal() method.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can sell houses via the sell_houses() method.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can mortgage properties via the mortgage_properties() method.
    </li>
    <li>
        The money is taken, and the money_taken() method is called.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    Note that when buying properties, you do not get to mortgage properties
    during the landed_on_unowned_property() method itself. Instead, if you
    choose to buy the property, the sequence of events above will then take
    place, and you get to mortgage at that point.
</p>
