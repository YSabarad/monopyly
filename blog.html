<p>
    Fixed a bug where mortgaged properties that are returned to the bank (when a player goes bankrupt)
    would remain mortgaged. They are now unmortgaged when this happens.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you to Huw Roberts for spotting this and pointing it out!
</p>

<h4>
    proposed_by_player
</h4>
<p>
    When a deal is proposed to you, you now receive the Player object
    for the player who proposed it, in the proposed_by_player field of the
    DealProposal object.
</p>

<h4>
    deal_completed
</h4>
<p>
    There is a new method on the PlayerAIBase API, received by all players
    when a deal has been completed successfully.
    <pre><code>def deal_completed(self, deal_result):</code></pre>
    'deal_result' is a DealResult object (monopyly/game/deal_result.py) which holds the
    details of the deal:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The proposer and proposee (Player objects).
        </li>
        <li>
            The list of properties transferred to each player.
        </li>
        <li>
            The amount of cash that changed hands.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Happy New Year, Monogymists!
</p>
<p>
    Monopyly now has a limit of twenty seconds total processing time for each AI
    in each game. The PlayerState has a property 'ai_processing_seconds_remaining'
    which lets you know how much time your AI has left in the game.
</p>
<p>
    I think that twenty seconds should be enough processing time for AIs. The samples
    only use a few milliseconds per game, though they are not particularly clever and
    I can imagine better AIs needing a lot more.
</p>
<p>
    The final will be played as a tournament of twenty four games between four players,
    so if each AI uses all of its twenty seconds, the final will take approximately
    thirty minutes to play.
</p>
<p>
    Remember that there is a prize - as well as considerable kudos - for the AI with
    the most efficient code. This will be the AI in the final which uses the least
    processing time per turn it plays.
</p>

<h3>
    30th December 2013

<p>
    Changed the get_out_of_jail() method. It is now passed the game-state
    as well as the player:
<pre><code>def get_out_of_jail(self, game_state, player):</code></pre>
</p>


<h3>
    22nd December 2013
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A lot more detail added to the <a href="api_reference.html">API reference</a> page.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added the <a href="going_bankrupt.html">going bankrupt</a> page.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added the <a href="making_deals.html">making deals</a> page.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    Started thinking about how to do the graphics. I had been thinking about doing this
    with pygame, but that seemed rather complicated and low-level. Bel Lobley gave me a
    good idea: to do the graphics in C#, and to communicate the game-state between the
    Python code and C# somehow. I rather like this idea.
</p>
<p>
    My current thought is to send data using a messaging protocol between the Python code
    and C# front-end. I'm currently thinking of using ZeroMQ and Protocol Buffers for this.
    To be honest, this may end up being more complicated than just writing the graphics in
    pygame, but it will a good excuse to learn ZeroMQ which I've wondered about doing for
    a while, and an opportunity to brush up on proto-bufs, which I haven't looked at in anger
    for a while.
</p>

<h3>
    17th December 2013
</h3>
<p>
    The coding challenge is now open.
    Welcome to all the Monopynauts who have already entered!
</p>
<p>
    Added two new events to the PlayerAIBase API:
    <ul>
      <li>
          auction_result() lets you see which player won an auction and how much they paid.
      </li>
      <li>
          game_over() lets you see who won a game and whether the game went to the round-limit.
      </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Cleaned up main.py and made it easier to switch between playing tournaments
    and playing a single game.
</p>
<p>
    Added information about the differences between standard Monopoly rules and
    Monopyly rules to the <a href="rules.html">rules</a> page.
</p>


<h3>
    15th December 2013
</h3>
<p>
    The first version of the Monopyly framework is now available. There are no graphics yet
    but the APIs and the game engine all work. The framework includes four
    sample AIs that you can use to help get you started.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you very much to Nick Pollard for helping test the API and suggesting a number
    of significant improvements to it.
</p>
