<h2>
    Making Deals
</h2>
<p>
    Monopyly has a simplified deal-making protocol which allows players to trade properties
    with each other and which allows cash to be included in the deal.
</p>
<p>
    I suspect that there is a bit of a prisoners-dilemma involved in the decision about
    whether to make deals or not. AIs that do not make deals will, I think, lose against AIs
    that make them, as the ones that make deals will be more likely to gain complete sets of
    properties. On the other hand, there is a strong incentive not to offer too good a deal to
    an opposing player, and this may result in deals not being made at all.
    Getting the balance right between these extremes will be one of the challenges
    in writing a good AI.
</p>

<h3>
    Proposing deals
</h3>
<p>
    Towards the start of your turn, you are given the opportunity to make deals.
    The propose_deal() method will be called three times to let you do this. A deal
    proposal consists of these parts:
    <ul>
    <li>
        'propose_to_player': the player (Player object) you propose the deal to.
    </li>
    <li>
        'properties_offered': a list of Property object you offer to the player.
    </li>
    <li>
        'properties_wanted': a list of Property object you want from the player.
    </li>
    <li>
        'maximum_cash_offered': cash you are willing to pay as part of the deal.
    </li>
    <li>
        'minimum_cash_accepted': cash you want as part of the deal.
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Either 'properties_offered' or 'properties_wanted' can be empty lists (or None)
    but they can not both be empty. At least one property must change hands as part
    of a deal.
</p>
<p>
    You specify either (but not both) of the maximum-cash-offered or minimum-cash_accepted
    values.
</p>

<h3>
    Accepting or rejecting a deal
</h3>
<p>
    If a deal is proposed to you, the deal_proposed() method will be called on your AI.
    You see the properties proposed but you <u>do not</u> see the cash component. You can
    reject the deal outright. If you accept the deal, you can in turn specify the maximum
    cash you will offer or the minimum you will accept for the deal to take place. If the
    cash amount is acceptable to both parties, the deal will take place. The properties will
    be transferred, and an amount of cash midway between what is acceptable to both parties will
    change hands.
</p>

<h3>
    Example 1
</h3>
<p>
    Player 1 proposed a deal to Player 2, offering Vine Street and wanting Mayfair and
    offering up to £600 along with the deal. Player 2 does not see the cash component, and
    accepts the deal wanting at least £400. The deal will take place, and the properties and
    £500 will be exchanged.
</p>

<h3>
    Example 2
</h3>
<p>
    Player 1 proposed a deal to Player 2, wanting Kings Cross Station and offering up to £300.
    Player 2 accepts the deal, wanting at least £350. Because Player 2 wants more cash for the deal
    than Player 1 is willing to pay, the deal fails.
</p>
